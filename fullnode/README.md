# Fullnode data

This folder hosts the _data_devnet_ or _data_mainnet_ folders for the alephium fullnode.

Instead of letting the fullnode loading the whole block history, you can help it by loading a previous snapshot. Please refer to the [related Alephium documentation](https://docs.alephium.org/full-node/loading-snapshot) for this.
